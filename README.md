I know basic machine learning.
First of all,lets assume that a life threatening disaster has been predicted(will also comment on this in a while).
Now clearly our priority should be the public places that are active at the moment and in accordance with their current population.
For this I am thinkin of a kind of infrared sensor that count the number of people in a room or in this case a building.
I had myself made one during an interhall competiton on applications of electronics.These sensors are iot devices that communicate to some master device in like a disaster management center-the key points being
1. The center being active or not
2.The present population in the building concerned
Now our master device is equipped with useful data.
Now we identify the buildings with maximum population and also apply some optimized clustering algorithms to give some high priority regions:-this step makes the evacuation,help,warning operations really fast.
Scattered high popuated buildings would now have lower priority than some less populated but close buildings.
There has to be some kind of a tradeoff,as helping force is limited in comparison to the total population of the cities.
These regions are now visited in order of their priorities by rescue squads.
Our rescue squads also mark the areas where they have carried out their operation and declare them safe to the master.
Heat sensors can also be employed in the building that can keep track of lively beings in the buildings and constantly communicate with the master.
If we go a bit more high tech,then we may even be able to pin point the exact locations of stranded people but this may increase the cost.
I think this system is totally feasible,very economical too.
Now about disaster prediction.
We feed our system with loads and loads of data on location and timing of disasters that have happened over a span of years.
Our system implements efficient machine learning and finds out the locations that are more prone to certain disasters and also the time when their probablity is high.
This serves only as a warning so that we can examine the condition more thoroughly,but in some cases like volcanoesor earthquakes->it may pe even more helpful.
We employ air pressure monitors that constantly evaluate the air pressure and send distress signals if pressure dops down too low->this indicates disasters like huricanes,tornadoes.
Water level monitors are also employed on beaches,which will monitor the water level above them,if enough of them show a drop below a certain treshhold then clearly the possibility of a tsunami or a hurricane increases.
After these steps,we can employ powerful satellite imaging to verify the situation.
So with these and some more similar devices interconnected to each other,we can predict and tackle disasters with high efficiency and low costs.
